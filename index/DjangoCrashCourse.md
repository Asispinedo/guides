# Django Crash Course Quick Reference

### Setup Workspace
  It is *highly* recommended you store all your code in a workspace directory that is easily accessible from the terminal and your computer's graphical interface. A great place is place your workspace directory right on your desktop or in your home directory. Keep your workspace organized by further breaking it into language specific directories.

```
  - Desktop
    - workspace
      - python
        - django
          - djangoproject1
          - djangoproject2
      - java
      - javascript
      - cplusplus
      - venvs
        - djangoproject1-env
        - djangoproject2-env
```
