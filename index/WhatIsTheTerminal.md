# What Is The Terminal?

### What is it?
The terminal is an interface that allows you to execute text based commands. It may also be called the console, command line, command prompt, or shell. 

### Why do we use it?
While it can be challenging at first, the terminal allows you to complete some tasks quicker than using the graphical interface that comes with your computer (file explorer, finder, etc). You can also run advanced commands and even chain multiple commands together to do all sorts of cool stuff quickly.

### How do I start it?
  * On Linux:
    * Search for "terminal" and open it
    * press Ctrl + Alt + T
  * On Mac:
    * Search for "terminal" and open it
  * On Windows:
    * Open your start menu and search for "cmd"
